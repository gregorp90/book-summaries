### Summary
Our intelligence and personality aren't fixed. The IQ test was invented in France with the goal of identifying children who are not getting the most our of the current education so that programs could be changed to suit them, not to rank children based on their capabilities. Our beliefs are the core thing that influences our personality and success.

There are 2 types of mindsets:
- Fixed mindset (FM). People with this mindset believe that their abilities are fixed and always try to prove they are enough. They take failure personally and negatively. This often results in inaction and the unwillingness to put effort into anything.
- Growth mindset (GM). These people believe they can grow their abilities. They react to failure by learning from it and taking action.

With a fixed mindset, people tend to move away from effot due to 2 reasons:
- If you need effort you are not smart/good enough.
- Since your abilities are fixed, you can't improve them with effort.

This mindset comes with a fear of failure. In a fixed mindset you have to be flawless. We can imagine being in a classroom and the lecturer giving us questions. With a fixed mindset we are nervous, because we feel we are being judged and that we have to show our abilities. With a growth mindset we look forward to learning something new in case we answer questions wrong and the nervousness subsides. People with growth mindset see failure in not learning, while fixed mindset sees failing at doing something a failure. You are not a failure until you start to blame. Fixed-mindset often looks for excuses, for example in sports, it was that I was feeling bad that day, there was some interference from outside, it was the referee, etc. 

Fixed-mindset people need to succeed because of their traits, which are better than othr people.  But what are you in this mindset when you are unsuccessful? They work in an either-or world, either you have it or you don't and need to work for it. Effort has 2 detrimental things for the fixed-mindset:

- It robs you of excuses. For example, one of the worst feelings for fixed-mindset (FM) is to give it their all and still failing. If you don't put the effort you can't be dissapointed.
- If you're a genius, or in other words have traits that are better than other people's, then you shouldn't need effort.

FM want to show their superiority again and again. But why would you be so proud of something you were born with? Of course it is Ok to appreciate your talents, but it doesn't make sense to put too much importance on it. Putting in the effort, that is something that makes more sense to be proud about.

The worse a growth-mindset person feels, the more determined they become. Dweck gives an example of depression where growth-mindset people carried on with their responsibilities and taking care of their lives, sometimes even more than before. It also gives us confidence in challenges -- even if you're not good at something (or especially then) you take the plunge. Often, you become good at it with effort. One great example of GM was **Michael Jordan**, who always looked to improve and did not look for excuses.

I often see myself in some of the FM examples, especially when I was younger. **Just knowing about the 2 mindsets can help us identify when we are in FM and we can act accordingly to move to GM. Often you can move between different mindsets.** It is not fixed, it is fluid, and can be based on some external information. We can also be FM in one area and GM in another.

FM is all about the outcome, while GM is all bout what you are doing, regardless of outcome. GM enjoys challenges, while FM sees challenges as threats. People with FM like to use their strengths to accomplish tasks instead of learning new skills that would help them later on. FM also believes that starting success tells you everything about a person and their ability.

Negative labels can be damaging. Just selection sex or race on a test can make you worse at a subject you are stereotipically worse at. The author provides an example of a woman taking a math test with many men in the classrom.

GM is not just about effort, it is about:
- Effort.
- Finding new strategies when old ones don't work.
- Seeking feedback and help.

GM should **not** be a religion. We all have GM and FM -- we need to identify why and when FM rises up.

### Sports
In sports everyone believes in naturals. However, the author provides several examples of athletes that became *the best* in their field due to hard work, most notably Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan. She also provides a counterexample of a baseball player that was great at everything but once he had one setback it all went downhill. His talent was his biggest enemy, because he did not know how to cope with failure.

### Business
Companies usually have mindsets. FM encourages group-think. This is a phenomenon where all people agree and even if they do not, they don't speak up because it is not encouraged. Group-think can be dangerous and is not uncommon in companies. The author provides the Bay of pigs as an example where no one opposed Kennedy and it resulted in a major failure.

FM bosses usually pick on other people to show superiority, usually the best performers because they feel threatened.

Negotiation can be learned with experience.

### Children
Praising children's intelligence is bad for their growth because it steers them towards FM. When children do something well, we should ask questions on what and how they improved instead of praising their intelligence or talent -- praise the effort not the person. We should also not talk about others in FM terms in front of children.

Parents often don't transfer their GM to children, because it is in their heads. They need to show it with actions -- praising sincere effort (not ability), seeking new strategies and solutions when a challenge or failure arises.

Some schools have also tried approaching bullying with GM. They wanted to educate the bullies, promote not judging and collaboration. The author provides an example of a school that managed to reduce physical bullying by 93%.

### Rejection
People with FM take rejection personally, feel tagged by it. Often they want to hurt back (for example, in love, revenge). On the other hand people with GM are quick to forgive and forget. They realize they can learn something from the rejection experience and grow. Change is the only constant.

Often FM is connected to shyness. With FM we are concerned about judgmenet and see such situations as risky. On the other hand people with GM see the same situations as challenges. This does not mean GM will take away our shyness but it wil help us deal with such challenges better. An experiment showed that GM people who were shy were still more social than their FM counterparts. They were not afraid to make a mistake and were more willing to engage in the conversation.

### Relationship
In relationship there are 3 things in which we can have a FM:
- My traits are fixed.
- My partner's traits are fixed.
- Relationship traits are fixed.

None of that is true. The romantical idea of everything falling into place with the correct person and staying so is an illusion. You have to work on a relationship -- "They worked (instead of lived) happily ever after".
