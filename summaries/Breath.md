### Summary
The book is dedicated to exploring and researching different aspects of breathing. The main takeaways are:

1) Breath throught the nose, not the mouth. Nestor even recommends using tape to shut the mouth during night. This point makes most sense and I've noticed I am more aware of my breathing now. In the end, we probably don't have the nose for nothing. I used to breath a lot through the mouth, but now I keep reminding myself to keep it closed. It's not an extensive experiment but it appears my rosacea is a bit better since I started this. Of course there might be other factors, but it's worth a try.
2) Do not breath shallow -- use full exhales. This will expand our lungs. We also need to breathe slow, making fewer breaths per minute as we are used to. Longer exhales also physiologically decrease our heartrate (see the Huberman Lab). When breathing at a normal rate, our lungs will absorb only about a quarter of the available oxygen in the air. The majority of that oxygen is exhaled back out. By taking longer breaths, we allow our lungs to soak up more in fewer breaths.
3) Breathe less. Use fewer inhales and exhales in a smaller volume. Apparently higher values of CO2 in our body are beneficial -- a very counterintuitive claim (see below). Training the body to breathe less actually increases V02 max, which can not only boost athletic stamina but also help us live longer and healthier lives.
4) Chew. Apparently chewing can affect how our breathing paths and faces are formed and with it how well we breathe. The more we gnaw, the more stem cells release, the more bone density and growth we’ll trigger, the younger we’ll look and the better we’ll breathe. Our noses and mouths are not predetermined at birth, childhood, or even in adulthood. We can reverse the clock on much of the damage that’s been done in the past few hundred years by force of will, with nothing more than proper posture, hard chewing, and perhaps some mewing (a technique to expand mouth, etc.).

Point 3 is not as intuitive. Even more, I'd say it is counterintuitive. Nestor provides scientific studies, so I would recommend looking into those, before making own conclusions. I'm not saying the author is wrong, but he often paints a picture in which breathing is the **only** reason for something. For example, he talks about a Native American tribe who are all tall, muscular and with perfect teeth. And he explains how they all have in common that they breath through the mouth, even though it is clear that there must be other factors (hereditary, location, nutrition, ...). This not the only such claim and because of this I've become a bit sceptical about other things he claims. Again, a lot of things seem to be backed-up by research, which I haven't checked out yet.

Breating call also help posture, such as scoliosis.

The perfect breath should be around 5.5 seconds inhale and 5.5 seconds exhale. Many religions have prayers that have the same rythm, for example Ave Maria.

A big part of the book is devoted to exploring different overbreathing techniques, which the author claims can be beneficial if practiced sporadically (meaning maybe once per day for a short period of time, for example). This containts Tummo, [[The Wim Hof Method]], several Yogistic breathing techniques etc. Some amazing feats are described that are apparently possible due to breathing. Some of these would definitely make sense to try out on our own.

One important thought that Nestor shares towards the end of the book, I think just before the epilogue: Modern medicine is good at patching up the body in extreme acute situations but surprisingly bad when it comes to curing chronic diseases. Breathing can have a tremendous positive effect on the latter, of course combined with other factors, such as nutrition, sleep, etc.
