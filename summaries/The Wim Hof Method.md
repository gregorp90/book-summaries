### Summary
Wim Hof is very famous for his method of cold exposure and breating exercises. The methods are supposed to make us stronger and healthier and might even cure some diseases or at least make them better including some autoimmune diseases. The method underwent several scientific experiments and it seems there is something to it, but it is difficults to assess to what extent. Luckily more experiments are still ongoing and there will probably be more conducted in the future as Wim seems to be happy to put the method under scientific scrutiny.

There are two chapters that talk about the method for health and performance and they are backed-up by several examples. One being Alistair Overeem (K1 champion) who trained with Wim to increase performance.

In the later chapter Wim delves somewhat into mysticism-ish waters and explains how we connect to our souls with the method. An interesting anecdote is that he apparently studied several eastern texts, most of them on Yoga, but could not wrap his head and spirit around them. That is, until he went into the cold water one time in Beatrixpark. At that point he understood what it means to empty the mind, which is a big part of Yoga and eastern religions -- empty the mind so the seer can dwell in his own nature, the seer being our eternal souls. There are some references to influential authors he encounered. I remember mostly Walt Whitman and Alan Watts, since they are more west-oriented. Might be useful to look into them, especially Alan Watts, I read somewhere he broughts the eastern culture and spirituality closer to the west.

Wim also talks about interoception, the sense with which we can feel what is going on inside our bodies and how the method and emptying the mind can help us with that. This reminds me of Socrates from The way of the peaceful warrior, a book that also focuses on emptying the mind. There Socrates claims he felt something wrong with his kidneys and drank a glass of water to alleviate the issue.

Overall the book read smoothly and the author's larger-than-life persona shines through. In the end everyone should try the method out for themselves for a longer period of time (don't give up after a week) and decide if it is for them.

There is also a discussion on the WHM in [[Breath]] by James Nestor, who also compares it to other similar overbreathing methods. While Nestor supports "less" breathing (see summary) he provides an argument for short-period overbreathing methods such as WHM and Tummo.

### The method
The method is fairly simple and consists of taking cold showers. At some point you are supposed to be comfortable and enjoy it, free from thoughts. As for the breathing, there are several good guides on Youtube and Wim even has his own application. I tried the breathing a couple of times already and it did feel good. There is the third pillar of the method: the mind. The mind represent the commitment to go into the cold, to do the breathing.
