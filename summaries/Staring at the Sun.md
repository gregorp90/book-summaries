### Summary
Irvin D. Yalom is an existential psychiatrist and touches a sensitive subject with this book -- the terrorizing fear of death. He shares many examples from his clinical practice and provides powerful ideas on how to overcome the terror and even use the awarness of our deaths to enrich our lives.

We often make the biggest transformations in our life when encountering death. The author provides examples of patients with diseases such as cancer, who after falling ill became less neurotic, were less scared of other people, and not afraid of rejection. In some sense, the disease provided a way to a more fulfilling life and freedom.

There are 2 modes of thinking:
1) Everyday mode. This mode thinks how things are -- how is our relationship, what are our responsibilities for the day, how will we repay the loans, etc.
2) Ontological mode. This mode thinks that thinks are. Here we become aware of existence and mortality.

Since mortality can be an unpleasant theme we can distract ourselves from it by the everyday mode. We are often thrown into the ontological mode by certain events, such as death of a loved one, losing a job, ending a relationship, etc.

The author provides several literary works that discuss the theme of death, most notably several works of Tolstoy. The common denominator in all could be found in the idea that to battle death we need to live the life to its fullest -- an unlived life will make death anxiety worse. A quote provided in the book by Zorba the Greek: "Leave death nothing but a burned out castle".

Death anxiety can also bring indecisiveness, which might not seem to be connected to our fears of mortality. Each choice we make brings with it relinquishment. With each choice we close off other options and opportunities. The more possibilities we close off the smaller our life seems and in turn we might be scared of not living to the fullest. However, this is just an illusion, as if you made another choice you would have closed off the one you picked now. And as Jordan Peterson discussed in his 7th rule in [[Beyond Order]] **the worst decision you can make is no decision**.

Epicurus provides a major influence to the content of the book with his 3 views:
- The soul is mortal. This means there is no punishment after death. Socrates, on the other hand, believed in an immortal soul.
- Ultimate nothingness. There is no I (ego) and death at the same time.
- Symmetry. Time after death is the same as time before birth.

### Rippling
Rippling is one of the strongest tools to battle death anxiety. It is passing some wisdom and comfort on to others. We ripple to other people, who ripple further, and so on. We leave pieces of ourselves in others. So the meaning in life can be found in meaningful connections with other people. "Look for her among her friends" -- find pieces of her in her friends. This is a powerful framework of life-meaning.

A similar theme can probably be found in [[GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach]], whose subtitle is "an Eternal Golden Braid". From what I've read on the book I would guess the braid implies the sharing of ourselves within others, who then continue the process, weaving the eternal braid. I find the idea profoundly beautiful. Hofstadter claims that the soul is a pattern in our minds and that by interacting with others we leave traces of it in their souls -- by copying parts of the pattern.

There's a saying on legacy -- it is not leaving something for people, it is leaving something in people. As my friend Aleksej put it: "It is about finding a fire within us and sharing it with other people".

"What we do in life, echoes in eternity." Maximus from the movie Gladiator, variation of a quote by Marcus Aurelius.
