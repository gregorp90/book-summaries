### Summary
This book reminds me of stoicism for the modern human. It does not go into the details and is by far not as strict as, for example, Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, but it presents concepts that are close to those of stoics in a more modren disguise. While often written in a humorous way which makes the reading very entertaining, the book contains a lot of great insights and recommendations into how to leave a more peaceful and fulfilling life.

We are raised to think that bad experiences are not OK, therefore we always strive toward positive experience. But wanting positive experience is a negative experience in itself, as it leaves you wanting. The acceptance of negative experience, on the other hand, is a positive experience, since you can move on and accept it, maybe even learn from it. A not-so-uncommon phenomenon is the feedback loop from hell -- being anxious about being anxious. If we accept that there will be negative experience and that we will be able to deal with them (see alo [[The Mountain is You]]).

If you give too many fucks -- in other words, if you care too much about too many things -- you are in danger of being **entitled** to always being happy and comfortable. That everything is supposed to be exactly the way you wanted it to be. In this frame of mind you will see every adversity as an injustice. These are all lies, it is impossible to be always comfortable and happy and therefore we should avoid this being our greatest want -- after all, this wanting will be a negative experience, which can lead us to the feedback loop from hell.

Not giving a fuck is not about not caring, it is about not caring about adversity and failing. We need to reserve our fucks for things that matter, such as family and friends. **The lack of adversity does not exist**. It is always waiting for us just around the corner. And that is **fine**. Similarly Jocko Willink writes about dealing with adversity and failure and explains how this only makes him go harder, find new solutions, and be happy he got the opportunity to do so in [[Discipline Equals Freedom]]. There will always be problems, do not go through life avoiding them, but rather **face** them. The more you practice (having a growth mindset will help here, [[Mindset]]), the more proficient you will become at it, so each problem solved makes you more resistant and better equipped to tackle the next one. Additionally, there will always be problems, so we should not expect to be alleviated of them. Our goal should be merely having better problems than we did yesterday.

As we mature we give fucks more selectively.

Often giving too many fucks is a symptom of having the wrong values, for example: pleasure (false god), material possession, always being right, always being positive (this is a big one). We need to admit that life is not all that great sometimes, if we are always positive this avoids recognizing problems and robs us of being able to fix them. Most of the wrong values are short-term. We should strive towards long-term values. Goof values are also controllable, for example honesty is good and in our control, popularity is neither a good value nor in our control. This is one of the key ideas of stoicism -- care only about what is in our control. Values are the main thing that make us entitled and addicted.

We shouldn't narrow down our identity too much, we will be in danger of it being attacked, of taking things personally.

Manson provides 5 core values/ideas:
- Take responsibility for everything that happens to you. We can't control what happens but we can control how to react. He provides a great quote: **"It is not your fault, but it is your responsibility."** So we should take responsibility and solve problems even if we are not at fault for them. We are always choosing and all choices bring new problems. It is up to us. There is a similar idea in [[Leading Without Authority]] that you are responsible for making things work, even if other people can't be bothered. "With great responsibility comes great power."
- Certainty is the enemy of growth. When we learn something we are not right, we are merely less wrong.
- Improvement is incremental, therefore we should embrace failure, learn from it.
- Paradox of choice. If we have too many choices we are afraid we made the wrong one (Fear of missing out?). But there is freedom in commitment. Once we commit to something we don't have what ifs, we don't question if we made the right choice. Freedom is in depth not width -- being engaged in few experiences but those deep vs having many experiences but shallow). Once you make a choice, stick to it. Of course we need to take this not-too-literally, if there is compelling evidence that our choice actually was the wrong one, we should reconsider. It has more to do with sticking to our choice in presence of arbitrary uncertainty that comes with too many choices. For this, we need to learn to say "no".
- Without death, superficial becomes important and important becomes superficial. From Wikipedia: "Meaning can be found, Manson claims, when one seeks to create joy in the moment for one's self and those around as opposed to being concerned with building a body of work as a legacy."
