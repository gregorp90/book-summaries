### Summary
The insigths are probably not particulary revolutionary, it seems more like a knowledge overview on the topic, and there is nothing wrong with that. A lot of advice is quite obvious (for example, do not drink caffeine before bed) but some details can be helpful even if you already do most of the other things right.

The following list summarizes the rules:
- Plan ahead for bedtime.
- Get more sunlight.
- Turn off devices before bedtime (especially phones).
- Do not drink alcohol before bedtime.
- Take supplements, such as magnesium or melatonin.
- Do not drink caffeine after a certain hour.
- Be consistent.
- Make the room cool (as in colder).
- Lose weight.
- Wake up early, consistently. This will help you fall asleep in the evening.
- Build a sleep sanctuary. Transform the bedroom into a place for sleeping.
- Get enough minerals.
- Get an orgasm.
- Find the perfect sleeping position for yourself.
- Wear the correct clothes, for example pyjamas that are loose.
- The bedroom should be as dark as possible.
- Work out.
- Set notifications to silent.
- Silence internal chatter. The author proposes meditation.
- Get grounded. This literally means to touch the ground (soil).
