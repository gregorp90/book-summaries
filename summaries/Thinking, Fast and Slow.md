### Introduction
The main goal of the book is helping us identify bad decisions by expanding our vocabulary regarding our judgments. While not expressed explicitly by the author it seems the main premise deals with decision making in the presence of uncertainty – which provides good arguments for statistical analysis when applicable, as statistics measures uncertainty. The author provides a very good example for that – see the librarian stereotype in the Origins chapter for more details. In short, if we describe a quiet introvert man most of us would think they are a librarian, rather than a farmer, because it fits the stereotype. However, we completely ignore additional knowledge that we have – there are way more farmers than there are librarians, so even if they fit the description, the probability of them being a librarian should be smaller than them being a farmer.

The book is dedicated to identifying when and why we make hasty decisions and how to tackle this problem. It provides guidelines to how our intuition, which is often very good, can be wrong and when to consciously turn to our more rational minds.


### Two systems
The author divides our thinking into two systems called System 1 (S1, automatic operations) and System 2 (S2, controlled operations). S1 represents our intuition and takes care of tasks for which we do not need to put any effort (driving on an empty road, understanding written sentences in our language, estimating which objects are closer). System 2 represents our logical thinking and reasoning – the author describes this as being us, or what we think of ourselves we are. S1 often works subconsciously and constructs a coherent interpretation of what is going on in our world. It is often also involuntary – for example, you can’t not understand a sentence written in your language. S2 is lazy and puts in only as much effort as necessary – we usually take the most efficient approach and changing that requires additional effort from S2.

S1 is based on heuristic decisions which introduce systematic errors or biases. See the example of librarian vs farmer where statistics are ignored and only a familiar stereotype is considered. An availability heuristic might be choosing something because it is more available, for example more news about a topic, being easier to find words that start with a letter as opposed to having a specific 3rd letter. 

Our thinking is based on both systems working in unison. In general, S1 takes care of “easy” tasks, or tasks that seem easy for us, because we practiced them a lot – for example a chess master seeing a mate position in 3 next moves. When we encounter more difficult tasks, S1 brings this to the attention of S2 which then takes over. For example, S1 might bring to the attention of S2 a weird noise in the distance. It is up to S2 to evaluate if we should do something about it because we might be in danger.

Sometimes we make decisions using S1, when we should be consulting S2. The author describes an example of an investor buying Ford stocks because he liked their cars, while an economist might first estimate if their stocks are undervalued. The problem lies in what question the investor was answering. We use S2 to answer difficult questions and “Should I invest in Ford?” is a difficult question. However, this question turned into a much easier question of “Do I like Fords?” and S1 can easily answer that. This is a common occurrence that we need to be aware of when making decisions – whether we are answering the right question.

Very often S1 is going to decide just fine, it is important to figure out when it will probably not and we should be using S2 instead.


### Ego depletion
Effort of will or self-control is tiring (see [[Discipline Equals Freedom]] for a counter-argument). Working on hard problems will likely make you give in to temptation in another decision. Or imposing self-control might make you perform worse on a cognitively demanding task later. See the Israeli parole judges example for more information (TLDR: tired and/or hungry judges are less lenient).


### Limited focus
S1 brings important things into focus for S2. But the supply of focus is limited and we can not keep focus on several things at once (for example, keeping a conversation while passing a truck on the road). A study was performed where the researchers told the subject to count the number of passes in a basketball (?) game between white shirts and to completely ignore the black shirts. This represents a hard task involving S2. In the middle of the game a woman dressed as a gorilla went to the fields and made some gorilla noises. About half of the subjects did not remember there being a gorilla. This illustrates how focusing our attention on a specific task can make us “blind” to other occurrences we do not deem as important to our priority task. This is related to the concept of **flow**, which became the term for activity that completely immerses us and with it provides satisfaction and usually professional success.

We can draw parallels here with Deep Work. In the latter work, the author emphasizes the need to lose distractions while doing deep knowledge work. One of the reasons for that might be that our focus is limited and all distractions take away from our limited supply of focus. Newport also touches on the limited amount of deep work we are capable of and the importance of taking a break. This can be seen as an example of ego depletion. In other words, if we only do very hard things all the time, the quality of our work might suffer.


### Conflicts between S1 and S2
S1 and S2 can come in conflict. The author provides an example of a psychiatric patient that was not satisfied with any previous psychiatrist. Our empathy and his charm will make S1 want to help him, but we might recognize his pattern as psychopathic and S2 would recommend that we do not.

This reminds me of another book, which I haven't read yet, but some ideas might be related. Steve Peters talks about 2 areas of our brain in The Chimp Paradox. He divides our brain into the irrational and emotional part – the Chimp – and the logical part – the human. Although Kahneman’s division is less about emotions, there could be parallels between these 2 philosophies. Steve Peters worked in elite sports, most notably at Liverpool football club where he was somewhat successful in helping the players improve using the concepts from the book.

Sometimes both of the systems are at fault for bad decisions to some degree. S1 can not remember important information or S2 is just too lazy to slow down and consider it in the decision making process. 


### S1 and habits
We can relate S1 to habits. Once we do something repeatedly long enough it becomes (almost) automatic. This is where the danger of bad habits comes from. S2 requires mental effort and S1 is often effortless. Once we develop a bad habit, S1 might take responsibility for it – it becomes easy. Breaking the habit will require the work of S2 – this is hard, our focus is limited, and so is our willpower.

On the other hand, taking up a good habit might convert it to S1 and therefore it will not present a mental burden on us and we will be more likely to keep it. Since S1 does not require mental effort, we can also combine some habits (for example, washing dishes or stretching) with tasks that require S2 (listen to an audiobook, deep thinking about any open challenges in our daily life/work). 


### Priming
S1 is susceptible to the so-called priming. It is best explained by an example. Kids who had to arrange words that reminded them of old people later walked slower across the hall. Similarly people who were shown money seemed to react more selfishly later. We often do not think outside stimuli can affect us like this – _since this is done by S1, we are not aware of it_ – but it has been shown often experimentally. This opens the question whether we can prime our mind for productivity and deep work. We can also relate this to recommendations in Atomic Habits, where the author proposed that our environment should work for us and help us with good habits.


### Cognitive ease
We have 2 clusters in our mind. The first cluster consists of good mood and related feelings and S1. We are much more likely to trust our intuition when things are going good. This also means we tend to be less careful. The second cluster consists of bad mood and S2. When things are not going good we tend to be more careful in our decisions. This would explain why confident decisive people often tend to be more cheerful than indecisive anxious people. Cognitive ease makes us use S1 due to it being contained in the first cluster.

We regard unfamiliar things as dangerous and they are therefore usually taken care of by S2, because we need to make rational decisions. However, when they are repeated and nothing bad happens they gradually become less dangerous. In time, we might delegate the handling of them to S1 completely.

Familiarity breeds liking. Unfamiliar is dangerous. But when it is repeated and nothing happens it becomes less dangerous.


### Norms, Surprises, and Causes
We all have some Norms that we are not really aware of in our mind. When we think of a small elephant we still imagine it bigger than a large mouse. 

Unfamiliar things surprise us, but this can be changed quite rapidly once they happen at least once. When an unexpected situation arises, we are far less surprised the second time we’ve seen it.

While something might not look normal at first glance, once we gain more information it might be normalized. For example, someone reacting weirdly to a soup is surprising, but when more people do it, we can come to the conclusion something is wrong with the soup.

“When we survey the reaction to these products, let’s make sure we don’t focus exclusively on the average. We should consider the entire range of normal reactions.” 


### A machine for jumping to conclusions
System 1 jumps to conclusions and is usually not aware that there were different options available. For example, if we have a sentence of people on a boat approaching a bank it will not think about the money-lending bank but part of the shore.

Jumping to conclusions is OK when the situation is really familiar and we have to make a decision in a limited time. This is where experience comes into play and is therefore extremely valuable. However, if the situation can be regarded as ambiguous and if we have enough time available, S2 should take over.

Some studies showed that the order of questions matters, since we prime S1 by using some questions to affect others. For example, in a survey they asked how happy people are and how many dates they went on in the last couple of days. In another group they switched the order of the questions. It turns out, many more people that have been on many dates reported that they were happier when the question of the number of dates came first. The assumption is that it made them think about something good in their life and therefore they reported higher happiness in the next question. When the first question was about happiness, they did not specifically think of this good part of their lives and therefore reported lower degrees of happiness. This is an important insight, especially if we are constructing surveys – how to get unbiased answers? Are we priming the surveyees in some way? On the other hand, this can also be exploited.


### Conclusion
The book introduces interesting concepts and provides convincing examples backed by studies by several other authors and scientists. It helps us understand that our intuition can easily be misdirected and that we should learn when it makes sense to take more time and think through our decisions. Knowledge from this book can help us make better decisions in our professional and everyday lives.

Last but not least, this book can have an immense effect on a larger scale. If you are in a line of work where some (relatively harmless) manipulation is an advantage, there is definitely a lot to learn here. On the other hand, we as individuals can learn to notice when someone is trying to manipulate us and help us decide on our actions in an unbiased manner (at least as unbiased as it gets).
