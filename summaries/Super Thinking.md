### Summary
The book describes several mind models that help us navigate through various situations we encounter in our lives. 


### First principles
A good way of approaching a problem is with the **first principles** model. In this model we break down the problem into its smallest parts. The author provides the example of Tesla looking for cheaper batteries for their electric cars. They learned how batteries are made and which resources they need -- it turned out they were able to make them much cheaper themselves.

Often we can approach a challenge by breaking it down into core assumptions. For example, our users will like our product, we will be able to ship/scale the product etc. Another model comes into play -- **minimum viable product**. This means you ship it quickly to test your assumptions before implementation and safeguards from premature optimization (which is [the root of all evil](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization)). Your first plan is never optimal and requires incremental change. "No plan survives contact with the enemy".

**Occam's razor**. Simpler explanation is usually more probable. Connets to overfitting, which is using a more complicated explanation when a simpler one is satisfactory. This concept is ubiquitous in statistics and [machine learning](https://www.datarobot.com/wiki/overfitting/) where a lot of focus is on preventing it, since an overfitted model can have very bad generalization (future prediction) performance. An example of overfitting in everyday life is googling symptoms and thinking we have cancer when the same symptoms could also explain a cold, which is much more likely since it occurs much more often. A similar concept was presented in [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]] where people misjudged guessing someone's profession because they focused solely on their traits and completely ignored the relative frequency of each of the two professions -- more common is more probable. However, we need to be careful not to disregard the alternatives but just adjust our beliefs according to the probability. In the example above using the Occam's razor would lead us to the conclusion of having a cold, but we can still assign some low probability to alternatives, such as cancer.

### Empathy
**Hanlon's razor.**  Assume that people do harmful things because they are reckless or incompetent and not because they are evil and wish you harm. This concept can relate to politics, where there is a higher probability that the issues they face are just too overwhelming for them and even they don't know what they are doing. Instead of assuming they are trying to control us etc. Another common example is taking offence online, where we can't read the body language and the other person just didn't think a lot about the wording, instead of assuming they were attacking us personally.

**Maximal respectful interpretation** relates to the above. We do not know the situations and mindsets of other people and we should always assume the maximal respectful interpretation of their actions, until presented with new evidence. This also builds trust.

**Learned helplessness**. We learn that trying to change things has no effect and cease to put effort into things. In reality, there is always room for change, especially when we think we can't learn things -- see [[Mindset]].

**Detach**. Other people will not behave like you and we should not expect them to. Our situations vary. We often say there are 2 sides to a story, but in reality there is a third -- that of the impartial observer. When in an argument, detach from your perspective and ponder on what someone else might think of the situation. The key is to describe the difference in two stories. Often a simple acknowledgement of the other side's point of view can have a disarming effect and can bring us closer to an agreement. **Just as you need variatey in food, you need a variety in perspectives**.
