### Summary
The book explores discipline as the engine behind improvement, success, and happiness. In other words, it provides a kick in the butt for the reader to get up and start doing, instead of reading, researching, and making up excuses. I would relate it a lot to stoicism and the growth-mindset described in [[Mindset]].

The tone is very black-and-white and extreme. Extreme in the sense that you get no time-off, that you always have to be vigilant, always trying to improve as if that is the only meaning in life. In the second half of the book this gets toned down a bit, when Jocko talks about taking breaks and not going 100% all the time -- he proposes listening to the body. Most of the writing resonated with me a lot, however I think the reader needs to be careful about taking everything literally -- seems like a road to burnout.

Overall I found the book great and definitely worth a reread every now and then.

#### Discipline equals freedom
We live in a time when motivational speakers and influencers are all the rage. You get your social media filled with motivational quotes. The problem with motivation is that it is not sustainable in the long run. Discipline is what is going to keep you going when you have bad days, bad weeks, when you're feeling tired, depressed, and without motivation. It will help you in your search for long-term happiness (success, health, family life, etc.) at the expense of short-term happiness (watching one more episode, eating a donut, sleeping 10 more minutes, etc.). A good example Jocko provides is that he wakes up early on weekends, works out, and crushes the necessary todo tasks for that day. After that, he can enjoy the day whichever way he likes. **In my opinion, this is what the title of the book is about. If you use discipline to do what must be done, what is right, and what is good for you, this will give you the freedom to enjoy the things you like doing.** 

#### Do
A major point in the book is to stop over-analyzing and start doing. Want to get in shape? Don't research all possible workouts and sports, pick something and start doing. Try out several and see which one fits you the best? Want to write a book? Start writing. Want to learn to code? Start writing code.

Jocko also talks about 2 important things in doing:
- Consistency. We can't drop the ball, we have to always keep moving forward, not skipping workout, not stopping learning.
- No hesitation. Hesitation brings absolutely nothing. It is the time between deciding to act and acting, some sort of limbo, a nightmare. Once you decide to act, act.

#### Detach
We are often guided by our emotions which arise from out perspective. Our emotions can lead us towards bad decisions and behaviour. How can we fight this? First we need to identify the need to detach -- notice that our feelings are taking us on the wrong path. Then we need to detach ourselves from our ego, from our perspective. With detaching we gain new perspective that allows us to proceed with reason instead of emotions. Jocko provides a practical example of detaching: take a step back, put hands at your sides, and lift your chin just a little bit -- a vulnerable posture. In time, you'll be able to detach without this.

In another section there is an interesting idea of using both, our emotions and our reason to continue pushing through. When logic fails us, when we see no reason to continue, we need to dig deep into our emotions and get angry and aggressive. On the other hand when our emotions tell us we should stop, we should use logic and willpower to continue -- detach.

#### Good
When something goes wrong, Jocko likes to answer with "Good". What is the meaning of this? It means other options have become available and that there is room for improvements, an opportunity to learn. While he wants us to be afraid of failure -- because this will keep us going in the right direction -- we should embrace failures, because they are inevitable, learn from them, and adjust.
